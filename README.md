# Cleanup My Files

## A simple command to cleanup the current folder
### Tired of a messy desktop? How about any other folder? "Clean it" with this!

This will place all adjacent files in their respective homes (**yourUsername**/Pictures, **yourUsername**/Music) on a Windows computer.

NOTE: Does not delete, or copy (no extra disk space used), just move(s)!
