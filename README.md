### tired of a messy desktop? how about any other folder? "clean it" with this!

This will place all adjacent files in their respective homes (**yourUsername**/Pictures, **yourUsername**/Music) on a Windows computer.

NOTE: Does not delete, or copy (no extra disk space used), just move(s)!

**For example:**
_Before..._

Location | Filename
--- | --- 
Desktop | **cleanup.bat**, image.jpg, song.mp3, resume.docx
Pictures | 
Music | 
Documents |


_After..._

Location | Filename
--- | --- 
Desktop | **cleanup.bat**
Pictures | image.jpg
Music | song.mp3
Documents | resume.docx

## Now cross platform!

Grab 'cleanup' without the extension and use it on Windows or Linux!

**to-do:** finish the linux version! it starts but doesn't move stuff yet.
